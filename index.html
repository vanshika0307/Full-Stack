    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" >Full stack in technology development refers to an entire computer system or application from front end (customer or user-facing) to the back end (the "behind-the-scenes" technology such as databases and internal architecture) and the software code that connects the two.
        In computer software and application development, full stack engineers are those with the skills and expertise to manage employees and projects and develop the code that will create or optimize integration between front end and back end systems.
        Front-end development involves the creation or optimization of visible parts of websites or applications (the "client" end) that users view and interact with in their web browsers or on their mobile devices. These front-facing apps and websites are typically created using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        Back-end development, on the other hand, involves creating and refining software code that integrates and communicates with an enterprise’s existing databases, software and other infrastructure (the “server” end) so that the front-end websites and/or apps can deliver the information visitors or customer need.</p>
